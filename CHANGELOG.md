* Introduced `skip` property to the `module.json` which instructs AutomationController to skip module class loading.

* Introduced `autoloadPriority` property to the `module.json` which determines automatic module instantiation order (lower -- the sooner).

* Introduced `caps` property to the Virtual Device which allows to list device capabilities.
