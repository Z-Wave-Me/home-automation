* UserCode.Set()
* crash on broadcast Basic.Set
* potential problems with Add/RemoveNodeFromNetwork/ControllerChange/CreateNewPrimary/RemoveFailedNode Function Calls.

Changes in frontend:
* Translations to Spanish, Russia, Deutsch. We will appreciate your help to translate our UI to your language.
* Thermostat UI fixed.

Major changes in software design:
* devices[x].data.ZDDXMLLang and devices[x].data.ZDDXML removed: client must load the file called devices[x].data.ZDDXMLFile.value from the backend and parse the language content.
 
!NB Some devices might require interview force to show properly Expert Commands and configuration parameters!
 

# 29.03.2013 v1.2

New Command Classes:
* SenorMultilevel V5 support (NB! Structure of SenorMultilevel data holder changed for all versions of this Command Class)

New features:
* /ZWaveAPI/Run/[...].data.[...] now returns dataholder tree in same structure as /ZWave/Data/[...]
* shortcuts for CCs on device and instance in JS syntax: you can now write devices[5].Basic.Set(255) instead of devices[5].instances[0].commandClasses.Basic.Set(255)* both "commandClasses" and "instanes[0]" can be omitted

Fixes:
* Unnecessary Command Classes on devices removed
* Queue handling after restart
* Line endings in ZDDX that caused UI to stop working
* More sanity checks to prevent crashes

# Release 1.0.1 (in progress)

* Removed `actions` and `metrics` properties from the `module.json` of all modules.
* Module classes automatically loaded to the controller. Removed `modules` property from the `config.json`.
* Introduced `skip` property to the `module.json` which instructs AutomationController to skip module class loading.
* Introduced `autoloadPriority` property to the `module.json` which determines automatic module instantiation order (lower** the sooner).
* Introduced `caps` property to the Virtual Device which allows to list device capabilities.
* Widgets moved to the new CommonWidgets module. Creation and registering custom widgets made possible.
* Module's templates and htdocs folders now resides in ./templates/<ModuleName> and ./htdocs/modules/<ModuleName>
* `config.json` existence checking on startup
* New configuration setting `vdevInfo` allows to set human-readable device names and tags
* Introduced icon VDev metric
* Introduced `VirtualDevice.deviceTitle` & `VirtualDevice.deviceIcon` methods
* VirtualDevice now requires `init()` to be called after instantiation
* Widget's htdocs and Module's templates moded outside of the module's folder (for all modules)
* Introduced .caps vDev's property which contains device extended capabilities tags (take a look at BatterPolling module)
* Introduced className property in the widget's meta-description which allows to set custom widget className (essential to custom widgets)
* UI is now capable of showing widgets created and registered by the customer
* Renamed AutomationController.widget* to AutomationController.widgetClass* and changed widget subsystem behaviour to resolve ambiguity
* /ZAutomation/api/widgets/ now replies with widget classes definitions instead of widgets itself. Latter exists and creates only on the client-side, but exact widget's class names described in a vDevs.
* UI Dashboard refactored according to widgets subsystem changes
* Fixed bug with loading ZWaveDoorlockDevice. DoorlockWidget implemented.
* Added `exact` command to the MultilevelSwitch
* SwitchBinary & SwitchMultilevel now has equal deviceType (switch) and different deviceSubTypes
* Added tags and locations subsystems
* Added support multi-profiles
* Added control widgets position
