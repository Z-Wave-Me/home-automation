	"m_descr":"Aeon Multi Sensor module was specifically written for the Aeotec 4 in 1 multi sensor. The perfect application for this module is when the sensor is used in a bathroom. Set the luminosity values and if the level drops to or below that value the light will switch on, if a dimmer is selected the light will set to the dim value configured between the even and morning hours; else it will be turned on at full range. Enter the humidity values and select another binary switch, in this case an exhaust fan to clear the humidity in the room.",
