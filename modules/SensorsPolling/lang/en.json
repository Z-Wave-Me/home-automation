	"m_descr":"The Sensor Polling App will organize to periodically ask all sensors to update their value into the User Interface. In case the module is not active, all functions of the Z-Wave System will still work but the Values shown in the UI and used for Logical Rules may be just outdated. This means a frequent polling is highly desirable to always the most recent information on the UI. However for battery-operated devices the most recent value is defined by the wakeup interval of the device.  In the time between two wakeups the device remain sleeping and will only report sensor updated if the device supports so called unsolicited sensor reports driven by a change of the sensor value. This means that the polling frequency of a battery-operated device is limited anyway and any more-frequent polling will not increase the user experience. Mains operated devices can be polled as often as you want. In order to prevent the Z-Wave network from overflowing with request and response packets this polling should be handled with care.   Hence the app allows to exclude certain devices from polling (good idea for always awake battery devices to extend their battery life!) and to define the polling interval.<br><br>Settings:<br><ul><li> Select the Sensor you do not want to poll. On default all sensors are polled within the interval set.</li><li>Choose the polling interval.</li></ul>",
