	"m_descr":"Due to a US patent some North American Switches (Wall Switches and Smart Plugs) don’t report a status change caused by local action. In order to have the correct statuses displayed these switches need to be regularly polled by the gateway. This app controls this polling. The devices and the polling frequency can be set. Please note this this app is a work around for a legacy problem of the North American Devices. You do not need to apply this app for devices sold outside the United States. Even some modern devices in the US have overcome the restriction. That’s why you can consider this app as a work around for legacy US switches only.<br><br>Settings:<br><ul><li>Poll all switches in Gateway, that are not updated within the defined polling frequency. Exclude switches and dimmers from this polling as you like via dropdown list. </li><li>Define the polling frequency. How often shall the devices be polled. Please note that heavy polling may create heavy traffic in the Z-Wave network and slow down other applications. That’s why there is no option to poll more often than every minute.</li></ul>",
